POE::Component::Server::IRC
===========================

1). What is it ?
================

A POE component that implements an IRC server ( ircd ). It's based on hybrid-7.2.2 and has 
been tested against hybrid-7.2.2 and hybrid-7.0. It supports the TS5 server-to-server 
protocol so should support networks based on this protocol.

2). What can I do with it ?
===========================

Run an IRC network. It supports linking servers and writing IRC services.

3). Something is wrong with it
