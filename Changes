    Services API is finally on the go. Hooks are in place to generate
    ircd_daemon_* events for a lot of irc events. Spoofed nicks are
    working. And it should all still work with plugins. Yay! 

  2006-05-05 17:11:53 (r43) by bingos; lib/POE/Component/Server/IRC.pm M

    Backend: Pipeline ported from PoCo-IRC; Changes to send_output to
    enable better thruput; Daemon: near as damnit complete standalone
    code; Server-to-server code embryonic; Service/Spoofed client
    interface stalled. Reasonably stable after load/stress testing.

    Added simpleclient.pl for testing purposes. Backend: now has
    connection idle tracking. Daemon: implemented nearly all IRC client
    commands, ( lacking STATS, LINKS, CONNECT, OPER, KILL, etc. ),
    extended 2_pocosi.t to suit.

    Common funcs moved to separate module. Few minor fixes to Backend
    related to client disconnection. Daemon: major works in progress.
    Implementing state and client command parsing. Peer routing is pretty

    A number of minor twiddles. A least the tests all pass.

  lib/POE/Component/Server/IRC/Backend.pm M;
  lib/POE/Component/Server/IRC/Daemon.pm M

    Partially documented Backend.pm. Made some more hacks to Daemon.pm
    fleshing out the start of message routing.

    Fixed a bug in the auth system by switching to using Ident::Agent.

    Started implementing state using AnyData in Daemon.pm. Added
    examples/test-harness.pl the code i'm using to test with.

  lib/POE/Component/Server/IRC/Plugin.pm M

    Updated the documentation in Plugin.pm, removed references to USER
    events as they aren't applicable.

    Additions to Backend to add plugin _load and _unload methods. Makes
    it easier for subclasses to manage their own plugins.

    With a tweak, tweak, here and a tweak, tweak, there.

    More tweaking of ::Backend :D IRC events sent by the Backend are now
    distinguished by 'ircd_backend_cmd_' prefix.

    IRC.pm is now a subclass of Backend. Added Daemon.pm plugin which
    will become the main state engine.

    Dramatic changes! Improved Backend and associated testsuite. IRC.pm
    is no where done.

    Added testcase for ::Backend 3.t 

  2005-06-13 22:44:11 (r7) by bingos
  lib/POE/Component/Server/IRC/Backend.pm M; MANIFEST M

    Finally got ::Backend working and firing off events. Plugin system
    needs testing.
