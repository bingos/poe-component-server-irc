POE::Component::Server::IRC is a POE component which implements an IRC
server (also referred to as an IRC daemon or IRCd). It should be compliant
with the pertient IRC RFCs and is based on reverse engineering Hybrid IRCd
behaviour with regards to interactions with IRC clients and other IRC
servers.

Yes, that's right. POE::Component::Server::IRC is capable of linking to
foreign IRC networks. It supports the TS6 server to server protocol and
has been tested with linking to Hybrid-8 based networks. It should in
theory work with any TS6-based IRC network.

POE::Component::Server::IRC also has a services API, which enables one to
extend the IRCd to create IRC Services. This is fully event-driven (of
course =]). There is also a Plugin system, similar to that sported by
POE::Component::IRC.
